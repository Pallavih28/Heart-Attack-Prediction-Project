# Heart Attack Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using logistic regression. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains various features related to individuals' health and lifestyle. The logistic regression model is employed to analyze these features and predict whether an individual is at risk of a heart attack.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Dataset Source]. It includes features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health indicators.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for modularized code (e.g., data preprocessing, model training).
- `results/`: Store model evaluation metrics and any visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-attack-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd heart-attack-prediction`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Explore the dataset in `notebooks/data-exploration.ipynb`.
2. Preprocess the data using `src/data_preprocessing.py`.
3. Train the logistic regression model using `notebooks/model-training.ipynb`.
4. Evaluate the model's performance in `notebooks/model-evaluation.ipynb`.
5. Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering for improved results.

## Results
Include any significant findings, model performance metrics, and visualizations obtained during the project.

## Future Work
Use of different models such as:
Ensemble Models
KNN model
